# 📚 Interactive Learning Notebooks

These Jupyter notebooks teach you the concepts step-by-step with:
- 🎓 **Explanations** - Theory and intuition
- 🎮 **Interactive Examples** - Watch algorithms work
- ✍️ **Practice Problems** - Implement yourself
- 💡 **Solutions** - Verify your work
- 📋 **Cheat Sheets** - Quick reference for interviews

## How to Use

```bash
# Install Jupyter if needed
pip install jupyter

# Start Jupyter
jupyter notebook

# Or use VS Code/Cursor's built-in notebook support
```

## Tips for Learning

1. **Run every cell** - Don't just read, interact!
2. **Modify examples** - Change inputs and see what happens
3. **Do the practice problems** - Before looking at solutions
4. **Time yourself** - Practice under interview conditions
5. **Explain out loud** - Practice the interview talking points
