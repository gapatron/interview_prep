## Study Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- Master ML algorithm implementations
- Understand theory deeply
- Practice explaining concepts

### Phase 2: Coding Practice (Week 3)
- Solve all Pinterest problems
- Practice LeetCode Medium problems
- Focus on graph and string problems

### Phase 3: Integration (Week 4)
- Mock interviews
- Time management practice
- Platform familiarization

## Quick Reference: Common Questions

### "When to use PCA vs LDA?"
- **PCA**: Unsupervised, maximize variance, dimensionality reduction
- **LDA**: Supervised, maximize class separation, classification tasks
- **Key difference**: LDA uses class labels, PCA doesn't

### "When to use AUROC vs AUPRC?"
- **AUROC**: Good for balanced datasets, shows overall performance
- **AUPRC**: Better for imbalanced datasets, focuses on positive class
- **Rule of thumb**: Use AUPRC when classes are imbalanced

### "What's the difference between L1 and L2 regularization?"
- **L1 (Lasso)**: Can zero out coefficients (feature selection), sparse solutions
- **L2 (Ridge)**: Shrinks coefficients but doesn't eliminate, smooth solutions
- **Elastic Net**: Combines both
